A quick experiment trying to combine [moderngl] and [pyglet].

We basically render the standard example game in pyglet to
an offscreen buffer and render it on a floating quad
in the crytek sponza scene.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `SPACE`
